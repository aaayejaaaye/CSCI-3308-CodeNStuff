# CSCI-3308-Final Project: Webpage Analyzer

This application will take in your chosen website and analyze the content of the page(s). This includes, but is not limited to, metadata about your chosen site, (how the content is shown, percentages) as well as specific analysis of the text!

We each bult out our own branches and eventually merged them into one project and hosted them on Heroku which can be found [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/website-analysis-csci3308)

If you would like to run the code you can go to the link above.
