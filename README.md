# CSCI-3308-Final Project: Webpage Analyzer

### Developed by Andrew Pickner, AJ Jones, Jake Henson, Fengyuan Zhang, and Yuxi Liu
#### To view any/all of our contributions to this work, please check out all of our individual branches. 

Our custom built Webpage Analyzer application will take in your chosen website (Or *websites*!) and analyze the content of the page(s). This includes, but is not limited to, metadata about your chosen site, (how the content is shown, percentages) as well as specific analysis of the text!
You can view and disable a pie chart about the data, as well as toggle data about the site(s) you've queried. 

We each built out our own branches and eventually merged them into one project and hosted them on Heroku.
